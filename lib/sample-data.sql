    VALUES ('Saint Cloud', 'Waxahatchee', 'admin', 95, 'Never short on great songs, emotional gravity, or artistic integrity, Waxahatchee (Katie Crutchfield) didn''t need to stray from the established sound and vibe of her previous albums to continue to move and impress us. Few artists find that elusive success. Rarer still are those who transcend it. Yet here we are. Saint Cloud is something of a seismic shift for Waxahatchee -- in a very particular manner. As if the ground shifted, though not  terribly far. It''s very clearly Waxahatchee, and even more so, the person behind the name. Like the album where you drop the band name and start using your own, it feels like we''re getting to the heart of her art here. It sounds effortless, hard-wrought, tear-inducing, and light as air all at once.', 'https://ia802806.us.archive.org/1/items/mbid-e66edb2e-4c59-43ea-a7f2-eb65dfbe8898/mbid-e66edb2e-4c59-43ea-a7f2-eb65dfbe8898-25713078380_thumb250.jpg'),

           ('I can hear the heart beating as one', 'Yo La Tengo', 'admin', 95, 'This is the album that introduced me to the band that has provided the most satisfying listening over time in my life. It is also their best. It''s not so much a singular statement, since Yo La Tengo have been making music at this level and in many comparable releases over decades, as it is an exquisite moment captured out of a much longer journey. That moment in particular evokes lonely nights, city lights, quiet and noise complementing each other as archetypal companions instead of adversaries. It is a marketing pitch for intimacy as well -- inviting the listener into the feelings and depths of simple, subtle, sad, and joyful connection.', 'https://ia801701.us.archive.org/30/items/mbid-dc5ee2df-7e5b-4a43-b67b-b9551e65c361/mbid-dc5ee2df-7e5b-4a43-b67b-b9551e65c361-3592364273_thumb250.jpg'),
